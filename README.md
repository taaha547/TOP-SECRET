## My Reasons so as to why this course and this repository
---
For **Way toooo** long, I have been course-hopping. It has had me feel productive but waste hours of time
I have now decided to do Web Dev and I will complete it, no matter what.

So here is the point by point reason i am here:
+ Accountability: This Keeps me Accountable, Alongside the joy of seeing your progress on github
+ Skill-Building: This will allow me to join the journey of webdev and I will be able to create Web Apps for various purposes
+ Application: I will be able to apply later skills that i will learn, such as AI and ML
+ Business: I will be able to create MVPs myself rather than being reliant on someone else.
