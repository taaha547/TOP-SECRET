        We are finally starting with HTML. I am very excited about this.
        We are  right now doing the structure of HTML Website. I am very excited to learn this.
        I am also learning a lot about VS code and how to use it effectively.

        We talked about Pair tags (Normal Tags) and self closing tages like img, br, hr etc.
        We briefly discussed attributes like the one in the html tag. He said that they are key-value pairs.

        You can also access more info that VS Code provides by hovering over the tags.

        Otherwise there isn't all that much that i didn't already know. But I was informed
        that this is going to get harder as we move on
        I know better than to quit at the start of a course
        We shall prevail.
