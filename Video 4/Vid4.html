    <h1>Video 4</h1>
    <h3>This is Codewithharry's fourth video.</h3>
    <p>
        In this video we learned about the basic tags, mainly the Heading, Paragraph and, Anchor tags.
        There isn't much to say i just need to get through these first few videos.
        Again, Won't make the same mistake of quitting at the start of a course, and trying to course-hop.

    <b>BUT I LEARNT SOMETHING COOL.</b><br>
    <p>
        If you hold Alt and click on any number of lines in this code editor i can change multiple lines at once
        without having to change each line individually. This is really cool. Atleast i got to know something COOL
        Infact i am using it right now.

    Also if you want dummy text, like some to just fill up space, you can just type "lorem23" and hit tab.
    It is a Emmet abbreviation. It is really useful.
    <br>
    See i am doing it right now.
    Also important thing to note is that the lorem's number can be anything, it doesn't have to be 23.
    <br>
    It actually dictates how many words you want.
    <br>
    Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Harum fugiat rerum neque veritatis. Quaerat culpa unde velit autem perferendis et facere optio hic. (lorem23)
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing. (lorem7)

    <br>

    Uk what? I wanna add some anchor tags just to test out the alt trick.<br>
